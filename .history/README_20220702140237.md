# ApexChallengeRandom
 
This is a program designed to provide a challenge mode for Apex Legends in which the user will generate a random legend and weapon pairing. With this pairing, the user will have to lauch with that legend and pick up that weapon first and they must keep that weapon for the entire game. 

There are some limitations to this challenge mode:

1) If the player does not have the legend selected, they must reroll the selector.
2) If the legend is already picked by a different player, they must reroll the selector.
3) If the weapon is a care package weapon, you can reroll the selector (unless you want super hard mode).

To run this program you will need:

Python 3.9.13
Plugins:
- pip install tkinter
- pip install customtkinter
